# 🐍 Python for Data Science — Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal repository where I document my full journey of learning **Python for Data Science**! by ***freeCodeCamp.org***🚀

This repo follows a detailed course that introduces Python from scratch and gradually builds up to powerful data science libraries like **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib**, finishing with a real-world project: a **COVID-19 Trend Analysis Tool**.
